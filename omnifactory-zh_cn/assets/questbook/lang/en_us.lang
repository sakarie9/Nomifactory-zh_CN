omnifactory.quest.db.4.title=Iron Supply
omnifactory.quest.db.4.desc=§c§rOres in §5Omnifactory§f exist in large clusters, or '§eveins§f'. These veins are scattered around the world, and are relatively common. The §aScanner§f in your inventory can detect any ore within 16 blocks of you, so digging down and scanning should show you any nearby veins. Try scanning now by holding §6right-click§f until the progress meter completes.%n%nWhile the Scanner requires energy to work, you are unlikely to deplete its battery. That said, the quest book will later guide you towards making a §aFlux Capacitor§f to charge tools in your inventory.%n%nIn order to proceed, you'll need to locate a source of §6Iron§f. You have a few options. §6Magnetite§f veins are higher up and contain large amounts of iron, as well as some §6Vanadium§f and §6Gold§f. Another good source of iron is §6Limonite§f veins, which contain several types of iron. Finally, §6Pyrite§f can be found paired with §6Copper§f in several types of veins.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is obtained simply by §esmelting Iron a second time§f. It has more durability than Iron, so it is better for making tools, but §cdo not convert your entire Iron supply over to Wrought Iron§f. The two materials are not interchangeable and you'll need Iron or Wrought Iron as demanded by various recipes.

omnifactory.quest.db.5.title=Mining Hammers
omnifactory.quest.db.5.desc=§aMining Hammers§r offer a relatively cheap way to mine out areas much faster. They clear a 3x3 of blocks and mine quickly, so they're absolutely worth investing your first few ingots of metal into§..%n%n§6Stone§f is the cheapest Mining Hammer, but naturally it breaks quickly. Since you have some §6Iron§f already, consider using those on your first few mining expeditions.%n%nThe best Mining Hammers are §6Diamond§f and §6Platinum§f. Other Mining Hammers are also good but wear out more quickly.

You'll also find §6Malachite§f inside of Iron veins, this is another type of copper ore.%n%n§6Tin§f: Found essentially at ground level, and almost always detectable by §aScanner§f from the surface. §6Cassiterite§f is another type of tin ore, and they're always found together. If you cannot find a vein of tin, there are small amounts of tin inside veins of §6Aluminium§f and §6Rock Salt§f, which might be enough to hold you over until you find a proper tin vein.%n%n§6Coal§f: Found in relatively shallow depths. §6Lignite Coal§f is just a less pure and less effective form of Coal.%n%n§6Gold§f: Found inside of §6Magnetite§f veins, close to the surface.

# db 9
omnifactory.quest.db.9.title=Ore Doubling?
omnifactory.quest.db.9.desc=In most expert packs, you want to try to process as little ore as possible before you get access to ore doubling. It's a habit most of us pick up.%n%n§eYou shouldn't feel any pressure to do that in Omnifactory, though§f. Ore veins are massive, and mining is extremely fast with §aMining Hammers§f. What's more, even once you get access to §3Macerators§f, they initially process ore slowly and require power to operate.%n%nObvious exceptions would be rare materials or anything you buy with §dOmnicoins §fbecause you can't find it. Those are worth doubling, if possible.%n%nBut at least for now, you shouldn't feel any guilt about smelting the more common ores without doubling them! §eOre doubling can be safely ignored until you have Medium Voltage machines or even later.§r

You can make it semi-automatically by prestocking the components you need, and filling up the Extended Crafting Table with §bJEI§r!%n%nThis Micro Miner can get you:§6%n* Bauxite Ore%n* Niobium Ore%n* Copper Ore%n* Tungstate Ore%n* Scheelite Ore%n* Cassiterite Ore%n* Radium Salt§r%n%nAs well as the §6Stellar Creation Data§r, which will be useful much, much later.

# db 11
omnifactory.quest.db.11.title=Electronics Subcomponents
omnifactory.quest.db.11.desc=A "§esubstrate§f" is the "board" part of a circuit board... the backing that the circuit components and wires are laid into. A good substrate needs to not conduct electricity, for obvious reasons. §6Wood§r coated in §6Sticky Resin§r is a primitive but effective material to use as your first substrate.%n%nYou'll also need to make §6Vacuum Tubes§f, as well as some primitive §6Resistors§r. §6Paper§r will work as a material for these, for now.%n%nMake sure to code these recipes into a §3Crafting Station§r... you'll be making a LOT of these things.

# db 12
omnifactory.quest.db.12.title=Some Starter Tools
omnifactory.quest.db.12.desc=One of the eccentricities of the pack you'll need to get used to is the way the tools are displayed. Most tools can be made out of nearly any metal, and §bJEI§f will display a huge number of options... every combination of every tool with every material. However, the pattern to make the tool is always identical, so §ejust arrange the plates and ingots in the same manner as the examples, ignoring whatever material it says§f. Rods where rods go, plates where plates, etc. The only restriction is that tools §emust be made from all of the same material§f... you cannot mix and match different metals in a single item.%n%nRecipes will default to showing a "§6Darmstadtium§f" tool (or sometimes §6Aluminium§f) of the appropriate type if a tool is required, but the correct type of tool made out of any metal will work. Just ignore the tool's material in the recipes: it can be whatever you'd like.%n%nFor now, make a §aHammer§f (not a §aMining Hammer§f, mind you... six ingots, not five). Hammers can be used to turn §etwo ingots into one plate§f. §6Plates§f can make a §aFile§f, Files can make §6Rods§f, etc. Use JEI to work your way down the list of tools.%n%n§6Wrought Iron§f is probably your best bet for a tool material right now, but better materials will become available as you progress.

omnifactory.quest.db.13.title=Batch Crafting In Style
omnifactory.quest.db.13.desc=If you try to craft each item only when you need it, you'll go insane. It is far more effective to §ebatch-craft§f frequently used items so you don't have to do it as often. It is very satisfying to get all the ingredients together then craft §ea stack of items§f all at once.%n%n§3Crafting Stations§f are an indispensable tool for batch-crafting. They can save recipes for all the steps in production chains for things like tools, circuits, machine casings, and more. You will want to §emake several of them§r§r for the convenience they offer.%n%nEach Crafting Station comes with some inventory space for general items, as well as a dedicated row specifically for holding §bGregTech§r tools. In addition, Crafting Stations can §einteract with adjacent inventories§r, so you can keep common materials in a container between them. This includes access points to large virtual inventories, like a §aDrawer Controller§r§r, which you will be able to make later.%n%nTo use the Crafting Station, you must either manually set up a recipe in the pattern area, or click-in a table recipe from §bJEI§r. Place the ingredients inside the Crafting Station or an adjacent container, then you can click the resulting item to craft it. Once an item is crafted, the recipe will appear on the top-right in the history pane. As usual, Shift-clicking the output item will craft up to a stack of it.%n%nEach Crafting Station will remember §eup to the last nine recipes§r you made in them, which can be recalled by clicking the item in the top-right recipe history pane. Old recipes will be cycled out, so if you want to ensure a recipe doesn't ever get replaced by a different one, §eShift-click the recipe in the history pane to lock it§r.%n%nThe available ingredients from neighboring inventories are visible through the §eStorage§r tab on the Crafting Station, and you can also place items into this tab to send them to available neighboring inventories.

omnifactory.quest.db.53.desc=The §3Wiremill§r is a major efficiency boost, giving you a much greater yield of §6wires§r for your ingots. But first, you'll need to make some §6Motors§r.%n%n§bGregTech§r machines are built from a number of components, many of which are shared between the machines. Motors§r are used in a great number of recipes, even including other components.%n%nMake sure to encode the recipes needed for motors into a §3Crafting Station§r. You'll need quite a lot of them.%n%nAfter you make the Wiremill, §econsider making a few stacks§r of LV motors. This might sound extreme, but §ebatch crafting§r in this manner is an important habit to pick up. This way you won't have to craft more for a while, and you §owill §ruse all those motors eventually, so you're not wasting materials.%n%nAs you get access to more machinery you will no longer need to craft things manually. Instead, you will engineer factories to automate the production for you.

omnifactory.quest.db.55.desc=Note: this quest accepts an LV, MV or HV Centrifuge.%n%n§3Centrifuges§r provide you with 3 tiny piles of additional materials when processing ore dusts (§e9 tiny piles = 1 dust§r). Sometimes it's the main dust, but often it's a different useful material that is otherwise unobtainable.%n%nInstead of washing §6impure dusts§r (made from macerating or hammering ores) in a cauldron, you can get more out of each dust by centrifuging it. The same is true of §6pure dusts§r, when you eventually make a §3Washer§r or §3Chemical Bath§r. Note however that pure and impure dusts will usually give different byproducts (always check in §bJEI§r).%n%nCentrifuges also have other uses like unmixing compound dusts and fluids, or getting §6Rubber Pulp§r, which can be chemically reacted with §6Sulfur§r to efficiently make §9liquid Rubber§r.%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.56.title=Putting It All Together
omnifactory.quest.db.56.desc=Now that you have everything you need to power your machines, it's time to put it all together.%n%nYour Steam Dynamo needs burnable fuel (like §6Coal§r) and §9water§r. It will output RF power through the Excitation Coil (the red bit at the top). The orientation of the Steam Dynamo can be adjusted with a §aCrescent Hammer§r, if needed.%n%n§6Energy Conduits§r can be used to transfer that RF power, but the dynamo can also output RF directly into a CEF by making the Excitation Coil touch the CEF.%n%nThe CEF transforms RF power into EU, outputting the resulting EU through the side with a red dot. The orientation can be adjusted using a §aWrench§r. Attach your §6Conductive Iron Cables§r to the output side of the CEF.%n%nNow all you need are some §bGregTech§r machines to hook up to the cables!

omnifactory.quest.db.60.desc=The §3Electric Blast Furnace§r is a major, major milestone in your §bGregTech§r career. It has the power to smelt more advanced materials. The first of which, §6Aluminium§r, is going to be important in the immediate future.%n%nThere is a diagram of how to build the EBF in §bJEI§r. The second and third levels must be a 3x3 square shape of Coil Blocks (§6Cupronickel§r is the only type of coil block you have access to for now) with an empty center. You can also §6sneak-right click§r the controller to enable the in-world preview.%n%nHowever, the bottom and top layers are very flexible. The §6EBF Controller§r must be on the §ebottom layer§r of the structure, and on the §emiddle of an outer edge§r. Otherwise, you can put the hatches and buses wherever you want, filling in all gaps in each layer with §6Heatproof Machine Casings§r. It's worth noting that you must §euse at least 10 Heatproof Machine Casings in your layout or the structure will not form§r.%n%nThis quest calls for two energy hatches, a fluid input and output, and an item input and output, which is a total of six positions. Their specific order and placement don't matter, as long as you can access them. The seventh position is your EBF controller, leaving eleven gaps to be filled by Heatproof Machine Casings. If you did everything right, the structure will form: the colors on its hatches and casings will unify, and the controller will say "Idling."%n%nYou'll most likely want to locate your power quite near to the EBF. It is very power hungry, and if it cannot get enough energy, progress on the current item smelting will start to regress. Be careful to ensure the EBF has enough power, and keep a Soft Hammer nearby to pause it by tapping the controller if you run out of power.

Cutting blocks into 9 plates is much faster than using a §3Compressor§r to make them one at a time, and some plates can't be made in a Compressor at all.%n%nThe blade will require you to make §6Cobalt Brass§r. §6Cobalt§r is a byproduct obtained (likely first as tiny piles) from processing any of various ores, §6Zinc§r you should have already from electrolyzing §6Sphalerite§r, and the other materials are just §6Copper§r and §6Aluminium§r. If you're having trouble, keep in mind that §bJEI§r has a tab for ore processing byproducts that you can get to by looking up recipes for the regular-sized dust.%n%nCutting Machines work with plain §9Water§r for all recipes. You can also use §9Distilled Water§r which speeds up the processing somewhat, or §9Lubricant§r that speeds it up greatly (and uses very little per operation). These might be a little tricky to make right now, but are very worthwhile upgrades in the future.%n%nYou might consider waiting until you have §6Electronic Processors§r before progressing too far down the path of MV machines, since these circuits are much easier to make than §6Primitive Processors§r.

When you're ready to move on to HV recipes in the EBF, you'll want to move up to HV Energy Input Hatches, and so on.%n%nHowever, remember to keep the MV area separate from your LV area. §eHooking up an LV machine to MV current will result in the machine being destroyed! Also LV cables will burn up if you put MV current through them§r. That's why it's probably best to keep the areas separate until you're comfortable and confident with voltages. Eventually you can use transformers to switch voltages within a single setup, but don't feel forced to try that until you've got a grasp on the basics.%n%nAll RF power is the same (it has no voltages), so you can use RF conduits to route power from wherever you're generating and storing it to §3CEFs§r for each voltage. You don't have to use this setup, but it's the most foolproof one for a beginner. And if you're an expert, well... you don't need my advice.%n%nFor your MV cables, you can use §6Copper§r to start with. §6Energetic Alloy cables§r are lossless though, so consider them if you're able to mass produce those ingots.

omnifactory.quest.db.227.desc=Here comes the chemistry.%n%nIt might seem crazy right now, but you'll want a dedicated §3Chemical Reactor§r for pretty much every chemical you want to process.

omnifactory.quest.db.228.desc=Yes, Snad.%n%nThis pack has §aSnad§r, which is simply a sand-like block that instantly grows sugar cane/cactus on top of it when it receives either a block update or a redstone update.%n%nThe sugar cane it produces can be used as a fuel for your dynamos, and later you can even brew it for §9Biomass§r.%n%nThis quest calls for a §aRedstone Timer§r, but there are other ways to make snad grow sugar cane even faster (like a vanilla observer clock pointing into the Snad). Make sure to set the timer to pulse as fast as possible.%n%nTo collect the sugar cane, you can use a piston and an observer. Later you can make an §6Auto-Breaker§r from §bActually Additions§r, which works even better and doesn't spill sugar cane everywhere.%n%nFor now, a §3Vacuum Chest§r should help keep the floor clean, and causes less lag than Hoppers. A §aVoid Upgrade§r in a §6Storage Drawer§r will automatically delete any items that overflow the drawer's capacity, so it's a good way to ensure you don't crash your server from accumulating a massive sugar cane pile before safer block breakers are available to you.

These will be crucial going forward for making a variety of components and machinery.%n%nMake sure your power generation and circuit production are up to the challenge. It is useful to make at least two of these to avoid recipe conflicts and for different programmed circuits.%n%nNotice that all numbers of required items are §emultiples of 12§r. This is to make an Assembly Line that's 12 units long, allowing for 11 inputs and one output. This is a large enough Assembly Line to make a §aFusion Reactor Controller Mk1§r, but you'll need to expand to more inputs for later projects.%n%n§aFluid Input Hatches§r can replace any of the §6Steel Casings§r along the bottom outside except for the Casings touching the §aOutput Bus§r. For the most part, ULV ones work fine, but a few recipes will need an LV one.%n%nThe §aEnergy Input Hatches§r along the top can be replaced by Steel Casings: you only need the one Energy Input Hatch (although you can add more if you want).%n%nThe §aInput Buses§r along the bottom §emust be ULV tier§r, nothing else. Make sure to spin them all so the hole is on the bottom.

omnifactory.quest.db.287.title=Fusion Reactor MK1
omnifactory.quest.db.287.desc=Time to get fusing!%n%nThe §3Fusion Reactor§r is a multiblock that uses enormous amounts of energy to fuse fluids into new elements. This one is less flexible than the previous GregTech multiblocks, as you can only put hatches where the preview shows. §6Sneak-right click§r the controller to enable the in-world preview.%n%nThe §bJEI§r preview shows §e§eall valid hatch locations§r, but you don't actually need that many fluid hatches. You can replace any of the hatch positions in the structure with §6LuV Machine Casings§r, as long as you have at least §atwo Fluid Input Hatches§r and §aone Fluid Output Hatch§r. It's possible to use input/output hatches in every valid location, if you prefer.%n%nBecause of this, the quest only asks for §a80 LuV Machine Casings§r. If you want to use the minimum number of fluid hatches, you'll need to craft an additional §a28 casings§r.%n%nEach §aEnergy Input Hatch§r increases the reactor's power buffer. §aAll 16 Energy Input Hatches§r are required to be able to process all Mark 1 recipes and give a power buffer of §e160M EU§r.%n%nIn addition to the recipe power drain, Fusion Reactors have a §eheat§r mechanic related to the recipe's §e"Eu to Start"§r. This amount of power is drained from the reactor's buffer before starting the recipe to heat up the reactor to the necessary temperature, and is independent of the recipe's EU/t cost. As such, this determines the minimum tier of reactor you need for a recipe.%n%nIf the reactor stops processing, it will §erapidly lose heat§r, even if you pause it with a soft hammer. On the other hand, if the reactor is already at the required temperature for a recipe, §eno additional power§r is required to heat up the reactor! This is true even if you switch between different recipes. This mechanic incentivizes continuous use of the reactor.%n%nIf you switch to a recipe that requires more heat, §eonly the difference§r in heat values is consumed as EU to reach the target heat (up to a maximum heat equal to the reactor's current buffer).%n%nFusion Reactors don't overclock, and they gate the next tier of materials, so you will eventually want to make more than one.

Alternatively, reactors can be designed to produce a decent amount of power for the mid game of the pack.%n%nFirst, set up your 54 §6Reactor Casings§r to encase a 3x3 cube shape of empty air.

In the middle layer, place the 4 §6Graphite Blocks§r on the corners, and the 4 §6Glowstone Coolers§r on the sides (so they touch both Lapis Coolers).

# db 495
omnifactory.quest.db.495.title=Storage Drawer Controller
omnifactory.quest.db.495.desc=§aStorage Drawer Controllers§r are the central hub of any good storage system. They can pull from any drawers they are connected to (via other drawers, or drawer trims) within a 12 block cubic radius. This leads to a potential 25x25x25 area to connect drawers, centered on the controller.%n%nThe appearance can be customized by crafting the controller into §aFramed Controller§r and putting it into a §aFraming Table§r.%n%n§aController Slaves§r do not extend the range, but rather act as another access point to that controller - allowing you to push/pull from any of the drawers within range of the local Drawer Controller.%n%nConnecting an §6ME Storage Bus§f to a controller exposes all of the drawers to §bApplied Energistics§f.

omnifactory.quest.db.498.desc=When making circuits, you'll need either molten §9Tin§r, or molten §9Soldering Alloy§r§r§r in the §3Assembling Machine§r. Soldering Alloy is made in the §3Alloy Smelter§r with a 9:1 ratio of §6Tin Ingots§r to §6Antimony Dust§r. You then process it in a §3Fluid Extractor §rfor the usual 144mB of fluid per ingot.%n%nThe Assembling Machine will only consume half as much Soldering Alloy as it would have consumed molten Tin per craft (72mB vs 144mB), so it's very efficient to use this stuff.%n%nPut your §3Centrifuge§r to work for the §6Antimony§r you'll need, which comes in tiny piles from processing §6Tetrahedrite Ore§r and §6Stibnite Ore§r.%n

omnifactory.quest.db.536.title=ZPM Machine Hulls
omnifactory.quest.db.536.desc=§6ZPM Machine Hulls§r are made with §6Iridium Plates§r, but you'll notice they also need §9Polytetrafluoroethylene§r (more commonly known as Teflon™), a special plastic which will be required for all machine hulls going forward.%n%nZPM stands for Zero Point Module.%n%nThis is the last tier of machine that's sensible to produce before you reach the §dCreative Portable Tank§r. Multiblock hatches are a different matter: feel free to upgrade your §3EBF§rs to Ultimate Voltage, if you can handle the power drain.%n

omnifactory.quest.db.537.title=Sterilized Growth Medium
omnifactory.quest.db.537.desc=§9Sterilized Growth Medium§r is needed for §6Wetware Circuits§r.%n%nYou'll need to mix §6Mincemeat§r, §6Sugar§r, and §6Tiny piles of Salt§r with water in a mixer to make §9Raw Growth Medium§r, then use a §3Fluid Heater§r to sterilize it.%n%nMincemeat comes from pulverizing any kind of animal meat.

omnifactory.quest.db.540.desc=The §3Extruder§r is an alternative way to form shapes from metal. §aExtruder Shapes§r are used for telling an Extruder which shape to make.%n%nExtruders are the only way to make certain things, like §6Large Pipes§r. Extruders use ingots, but are as efficient for making §6Gears§r as melting and solidifying.%n%nYou can also use Extruders to make things from other machines like plates and wires, but they are less efficient than using the dedicated machines for these purposes.

omnifactory.quest.db.541.desc=Overclocking aside, as you continue to progress in §5Omnifactory§f, materials made in the §3Electric Blast Furnace§f will take longer to complete. §eMore advanced coils do not give speed bonuses§f, only allowing for the furnace to §eget hot enough to process more advanced materials§f.%n%nConsequently, you'll need to continually expand your smelting and power generation infrastructure.%n%nYou don't have to get all four of these Electric Blast Furnaces completed and running just yet, but be prepared to make many of them over the course of the pack.

omnifactory.quest.db.546.desc=Note: this quest accepts both LV and MV Distillery.%n%nIf you don't feel up to making a §3Distillation Tower§r just yet, you can get §9Ethanol§r via a single block §3Distillery§r, a machine that gets one fluid output per §6Integrated Circuit§r configuration, while the §3Distillation Tower§r gives all possible outputs for the input fluid. This defers the tower for a little while longer.%n%nHowever, the Distillation Tower is mandatory for advanced chemistry, as most things have more than one important output: §9Fermented Biomass§r, §9Charcoal Byproducts§r from your §3Pyrolyse Oven§r, and the entire line of petrochemicals from §9Oil§r, to name a few.%n%nCan't avoid it forever!%n%n

# db 547
omnifactory.quest.db.547.title=Scanner Module: Block
omnifactory.quest.db.547.desc=A good way to find a specific ore you're missing is the §6Scanner Module: Block§r for your Scanner. §6Sneak-right click§f a piece of ore you want to search for with a Module in your hand, then §6sneak-right click§f the §aScanner§f, put the module inside, and go wander around scanning. %n%nThe range is significantly longer than it is when using the modules which detect all ores, and you even have room for a second §6Range Module§f if you've got an §6Ender Pearl§f to craft one.%n%nYou can combo this with ores bought from §dOmnicoins§f to act as a "sample" to easily find a full vein with the Block Module.

# db 548
omnifactory.quest.db.548.title=Molds
omnifactory.quest.db.548.desc=§aMolds§r are used in a §3Fluid Solidifier§r or §3Alloy Smelter§r to form materials into specific shapes. These are not consumed or damaged during crafting, so you can leave them in a machine to dedicate it to that shape.%n%nThe Fluid Solidifier tends to be the more efficient option: for example, you can use §e8 ingots§r to make one §6Gear§r in an Alloy Smelter, but with a Fluid Extractor and Solidifier you can accomplish the same result with §e4 ingots§r.%n%nBe careful not to accidentally make §aExtruder Shapes§r. Those are for a machine you will get access to later. The three molds in this quest are ones you will find useful right away.

omnifactory.quest.db.549.desc=If you don't like the idea of mining out Oilsands veins, you can build an §3Oil Drilling Rig§r.%n%nYou'll need to provide it with power, §9Drilling Fluid§r, and a steady supply of §6Pipes§r. The Pipes only have a 1%% chance to break per bucket of §9Oil§r drilled.%n%nYou'll need to supply at least §eHV power§r to your rig, and it will overclock with higher energy tiers. Positions of hatches and buses can be swapped with any §6Solid Steel Machine Casing§r.%n%nIf the multiblock preview in §bJEI§r is confusing, note that you can §ehold shift and drag-right-click§r to scale the preview to fit the window. Place then §6sneak-right click§r the controller block with an empty hand to enable the in-world preview.%n%nKeep in mind when placing the structure that there are 12 pipes that extend downward from the level of the controller.%n

omnifactory.quest.db.550.title=Vertical Digger
omnifactory.quest.db.550.desc=Place the §3Vertical Digger§r over an ore vein, feed it RF, and it will mine up the entire vein for you.%n%nFor drills, you will need a §6GregTech Drill§r (any LV drill will work), a §6Fluxbore§r (Reinforced tier is required) and an §6Actually Additions Drill§r (any color is fine, but take out any augments you wish to keep).%n%nThe GregTech Drill will not be consumed, but everything else will be.

Eventually you'll need to make both, but not for a long time, so feel free to ignore at least one of these quest chains unless you really really like flying.%n%nIf the §6Jetpack§r overview and information from §bThe One Probe§r conflict, they can be adjusted through the §bSimply Jetpacks 2§r §eConfiguration file§r or the command §6/topcfg§r respectively.

omnifactory.quest.db.558.desc=This is an augment that will work in all §3dynamos§f. It increases the efficiency of the fuel being used inside the dynamo, increasing the power it generates. However, the rate of power generation remains the same, the fuel simply lasts longer. So, while §6Fuel Catalyzers§f decrease the amount you'll need to go mining for §6Coal§f, they won't boost your production of RF per second.%n%nEach Fuel Catalyzer increases fuel efficiency by §a15%%§f, additively (so two will make fuel last §a30%% longer§f, three is §a45%% longer§f, etc.).

omnifactory.quest.db.559.desc=The §aAuxiliary Transmission Coil §ris an augment that will work in all types of dynamos. It will consume fuel faster to produce a correspondingly higher RF per tick.%n%nEach augment increases both base power production and fuel consumption by 100%%, additively (so the second is 200%%, third is 300%%, etc.).%n%nConsider the tradeoffs however, as you could just make another dynamo, and you miss out on §aFuel Catalyzer§r augments that make fuels burn longer for more total RF generated. The Auxiliary Transmission Coil will put additional stress your fuel production infrastructure.%n%nIf that's an acceptable tradeoff, then Auxiliary Transmission Coils are a cheap and effective way to boost your power production.

omnifactory.quest.db.727.desc=When you first started the pack, we told you that ore doubling can wait, and that's true... But you will need to start doing some rudimentary ore processing for §ebyproducts§r.%n%nByproducts are additional materials that can only be obtained from processing ores in certain machines. For example, there is no "Gallium Ore". You get §6Gallium§r as a byproduct from processing other ores.%n%nOres have various means of processing, and eventually you'll use machine pipelines to process ores in specific ways to optimize what byproducts you gain. You can look at the §b§b§6Ore Byproduct Page§6§r of an ore in §bJEI§r, accessed by pressing 'U' on an ore and navigating to the byproduct tab, to see the required route to obtain desired byproducts. The tooltips on a byproduct will specify what processing method is needed to obtain it.%n%nThe relevant machines are as follows:%n %n- §3Macerator§r: turns ores into §6Crushed Ores§r, Crushed Ores into §6Impure Dusts§r, and §6Purified Crushed Ores§r into §6Pure Dusts§r. Higher tiers of macerators have byproduct slots and gain a chance to get a full pile of byproduct from ores and both types of crushed ores.%n%n- §3Washer§r: cleans Crushed Ores with §9Water§r, making Purified Crushed Ores§r, and a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct. Using §9Distilled Water§r makes them go faster. This is an improved alternative to dropping dusts in a Cauldron.%n%n- §3Chemical Bath§r: similar to a washer, but uses chemicals to purify the crushed ores. Has a chance to give a full pile of byproducts, often different than what the Washer would give.%n%n- §3§3Centrifuge§r: separates Pure or Impure dusts into the final material, producing a guaranteed 3 tiny piles of byproduct.%n%n- §3Electrolyzer§r: uses power to split compounds into individual elements, sometimes gaining useful byproducts in the process.%n%nThe §3Thermal Centrifuge§r, not to be confused with the regular Centrifuge, can be used for alternative ore processing but is §edreadfully slow and power-hungry§r. No LV form exists, and its primary use is for §bNuclearCraft§r fission fuels.%n%nYour first forays into ore processing for byproducts will be the Electrolyzer and the Centrifuge.%n

Instead you should make §6Resonant Clathrates§r, which are an infinitely-renewable and effective source of Pulsating Dust.%n%nResonant Clathrates are made by melting §6Ender Pearls§r with a §3Fluid Extractor§r into §9Resonant Ender§r, then mixing that with §6Nether Quartz§r in an MV or better §3Chemical Reactor§r. Smelting this clathrate gives Pulsating Dust.%n%nWith Resonant Clathrates now accessible, everything you need for crafting §6Pulsating Polymer Clay§r can be automated in a net-positive loop.§r Doing so is a boon to automation of §bDeep Mob Learning§r, which is §ea primary source of important materials for the rest of the pack§r.%n%nThe exact implementation is up to you.

You can use §aPump covers§r on §bGregTech§r machines to pull fluids from or extract fluids into an interface. This is useful for routing fluids if you're already using the output side for items or a different fluid.%n%nIt is also far more performant and scales better without lag than §aFluid Import/Export Buses§r.

A §aCapacity Card§r will let you export or import five specific chemicals through a single bus, which is enough for, say, §3Chemical Reactors§r. However, §cexcessive use of AE2 buses will cause lag§r.%n%nA better approach for §bGregTech§r machines is using a stocked §aFluid Interface§r and a §aPump§r or a §aFluid Regulator§r. This works almost identically to passive autocrafting with Robot Arms, and §aFluid Filters§r can allow routing specific fluids to adjacent machines. This method is much more performant, scaling without causing lag like buses. For machines from other mods, you can route fluids from a Fluid Interface with conduits.%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.731.desc=Your §3Chemical Reactors§r will be making a lot of different fluids. You'll need to manage the logistics of routing and storing all the different fluids you're automating.%n%nWherever possible, having one Chemical Reactor output directly into another machine that needs its output chemical saves you from having to figure out additional storage and routing. §aFluid Filters§r and §aPump covers§r are very useful for moving fluids around a compact processing pipeline.%n%nBut what about the final output fluids that you need elsewhere?%n%nOne option is to use the output tanks of the Chemical Reactors as a small storage buffer, letting it back up and stop crafting automatically. A §aFluid Storage Bus§r on the machine will expose the fluid to your ME Network. Whenever you need some of this fluid, your AE2 system will pull the needed fluid out and the machine will resume processing.%n%nThere's some catches with this approach though. First is that the inaccessible input tanks will also show up in AE but you won't be able to access them. You will want to set the Storage Bus to §eExport Only§r so AE doesn't try to store random fluids in the Chemical Reactor, and you may want to §ereduce the priority§r of the Storage Bus as well: this will signal to AE that you want it to remove fluids from that location first. Also, if multiple fluids are produced, §ethe machine will not resume processing if it doesn't have room for all fluid outputs§r.%n%nWhen you get access to them, it's probably just better to use single-fluid-formatted §aFluid Storage Cells§r and dump outputs into AE via Fluid Interfaces. You can fill up the cells, then pull the fluids out wherever else you need them.%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.787.title=Farming Station
omnifactory.quest.db.787.desc=The §3Farming Station§r is a machine that automates growing and harvesting trees and crops around it, based on what items you put in it.%n%nThe Farming Station will principally collect crops, saplings, and wood, but it will also collect things like §6Apples§r from Oak Trees and §6Sticky Resin§r from Rubber Trees. It can also collect leaves if you want it to.%n%nLike other §bEnderIO§r machines, it requires an §6RF capacitor§r. The quality of capacitor affects the overall size of the farm as well as the speed and energy at which it operates.%n%nYou can configure which crops or tree types will be planted relative to the Farming Station by placing the crop or sapling in the various quadrants in the GUI. Clicking the lock button will ensure that the stack placed there won't be completely consumed, as that could lead to plants migrating to other quadrants.%n%nIn addition to power, the Farming Station§r requires specific §etools§r (and usually a supply of §9Water§r) to operate. If you're missing anything, the machine will refuse to operate and displays a message over itself to let you know.%n%nFor planting §6crops§r or §6saplings§r, you need a §aHoe§r.%nFor chopping §6trees§r, you need an §aAxe§r. To collect §6leaves§r, you also need §aShears§r.%n%nTool durability is consumed as the farm performs work, so the tools will eventually break. You can make §aStone Tools§r from a cobblestone generator and some sticks, or even §aDiamond Tools§r using diamonds from your §3Deep Mob Learning§r setup.%n%nAlternately, you can invest in fancier tools such as th§re §aDark Backhoe§r (which is designed for use in the Farming Station), or even unbreakable tools much later like the §aFlux Infused Axe§r and §aOmniwrench§r (shears).%n%nThe Farming Station also has a lesser-known feature: it respects enchantments and upgrades on your tools. Tools with §eEmpowered§r upgrades will be ejected into the output slots when they run out of charge (if they don't break first). Tools with the §eMending§r enchantment are similarly ejected when they are about to break.%n%nYou can use these properties to your advantage.%n%n

omnifactory.quest.db.788.title=Smart Item Filter
omnifactory.quest.db.788.desc=The §6Smart Item Filter§r from §3GregTech§r is an important tool when automating otherwise troublesome machines. It is a cover which filters item transfer based on whether a valid recipe exists for those items in a specified machine.%n%nThis is powerful in combination with movement covers like the §6Robot Arm§r. If you place this filter on the §eElectrolyzer§r mode in a Robot Arm set to §eSupply Exact§r mode, the Robot Arm will transfer precisely the right amounts of all valid items into an §3Electrolyzer§r so it will operate without clogging. There's no other way to accomplish this feat!%n%nThis filter also has §eSifter§r and §eCentrifuge§r§r modes for use with those machines (though §3Sifters§r are not in §5Omnifactory§r). It does not have modes for any other machines.%n%nThe §eDefault§r button lets you click it to §eIgnore Fluids§r, which is useful when you have recipes that also require fluids (like §9Hydrogen§r in an Electrolyzer). Since Robot Arms can't move fluids, it would otherwise prevent the cover from working.%n

# db 789
omnifactory.quest.db.789.title=Filters
omnifactory.quest.db.789.desc=§aFilters§r are a type of machine cover that controls what items or fluids are allowed to pass through it. They can be used directly on the side of a machine to affect external automation or the Machine's §aAuto-Output Functionality§r.%n%nYou can also §eplace filters inside of other covers§r to control what items or fluids that cover will interact with. When used in a §6Robot Arm§r, §aItem Filters§r make for a powerful automation tool for §ekeeping specific items in stock§r in specific quantities in Machines. With §6Fluid Regulators§r, similar behavior is possible with fluids using a §aFluid Filter§r. For §6Conveyors§r and §6Pumps§r, it simply limits what that cover will move.%n%n§aFilters§r all have 9 configurable slots and whitelist/blacklist modes, and can be applied to multiple sides of machines. When placed inside a §6Robot Arm§r in §eKeep Exact§r or §eSupply Exact§r mode§r, the item count in a filter can be incremented by §eRight Clicking§r and decremented by §eLeft Clicking§r. Holding §eShift§r causes the count to increase/decrease by a factor of 2. This controls the number of each type of item that will be kept in stock or moved at a time.%n%nSimilar controls are available for the §aFluid Filter§r when placed inside a §6Fluid Regulator§r.%n%nAdditionally, the §aOre Dictionary Filter§r§r is a powerful tool that has a specialized filter which uses ore dictionary entries and supports "*" as a wildcard, e. g. "§6ingotHot*§r" will match all hot ingots, "§6dustRegular*§r" will match all regular dusts, and "§6dustTiny*§r" will match all tiny piles.%n%nAll §bGregTech§r Filters can be configured using ghost items from §bJEI§r.

omnifactory.quest.db.790.desc=The §6Machine Controller§r is a cover that manages the operation of §bGregTech§r machines, similar to a §aSoft Hammer§r. These are crucial for §epassive automation§r, where a machine is dedicated to keeping something in stock for you.%n%n"Machines" here is broader than you might think. It of course works on single-block machines, but can also be used on §eMultiblock Controllers§r like your §3Electronic Blast Furnace§r. But it's even more flexible than that: you can use it on any §bGregTech§r block that accepts transfer covers, as long as the controllable cover is placed on it first! This means it also works for things like §6Chests§r, §6Drums§r, and Multiblock inputs.%n%nThe cover works by detecting a §eredstone signal§r. By default, the entire machine will be disabled if a sufficiently strong signal is detected by the cover.%n%nWhen you open the Machine Controller's GUI with a §aScrewdriver§r, you will see several options for configuring its behavior:%n%nThe strength of the signal required to trigger the Machine Controller is configurable using the top slider.%n%nAnother button allows you to select whether to control the whole machine (where applicable) or a specific cover. This lets you do things like stop moving items into a machine, but also allow the machine to continue working.%n%nSwitching from §eNormal§r to §eInverted§r mode will make the Machine Controller instead disable the machine until it receives the requisite redstone signal. This is often preferable when working with §6Level Emitters§r to prevent machines from starting up if your §eME Network§r is offline.%n%nSome use cases:%n• Control machines through vanilla redstone contraptions or a simple lever.%n%n• The §6Redstone Upgrades§r from §bStorage Drawers§r can be used when outputting into a drawer to make the drawer emit redstone that can control the machine.%n%n• When you progress to digital storage, an §6ME Level Emitter§r or §6ME Fluid Level Emitter§r can be used to emit signal based on specific items or fluids in your network.%n

omnifactory.quest.db.791.title=Processing Array
omnifactory.quest.db.791.desc=The §6Processing Array§r is a §bGregTech§r multiblock that allows for processing multiple recipes in parallel in a single stucture and is extremely useful for saving space.%n%nUp to 16 of the same recipe can be processed in parallel by placing the machines for the recipe in exactly one §aMachine Access Interface§r in the multiblock structure, as well as the ingredients and non-consumable items (like §6Integrated Circuits§r) for the recipe you want to process in one or more input buses. While a recipe is running, the Machine Access Interface is §elocked§r and machines cannot be added or removed.%n%nNote that each machine will still draw the full voltage required for the recipe, which may be more than a single §aEnergy Input Hatch§r can provide. This is why the §6Processing Array§r has an astounding Hatch limit, and can support up to §e8 Energy Inputs§r on the structure. This allows you to get the needed 16 Amps of power to the machine from a single tier-appropriate §3CEF§r.%n%nProcessing Arrays distribute their buffered power at the appropriate voltage, so there's no danger of your machines exploding if you, for example, operate 16 HV machines off one amp of IV power.%n%nBecause the required number of Inputs, Outputs, and Casings is highly variable, this quest only asks you to craft the §6Processing Array Controller§r and the §aMachine Access Interface§r. Make sure your buses and hatches are large enough to hold the ingredients and outputs for the number of parallel crafts you're attempting, and that you're providing enough power for all those machines!%n%nAn advanced feature of the Processing Array is §eDistinct Bus Mode§r. This makes the Processing Array only consider a single item input bus at a time when determining whether it can run a recipe. This is useful when recipes for a particular machine require different catalyst items, like §6Integrated Circuits§r on different configurations or §6Extruder Shapes§r.%n%nDistinct Bus Mode may be enabled or disabled via the Processing Array controller by clicking in the designated area.%n%n

Up until now, it has been possible to dump ingredients into a single input bus. Clearly, this won't work for the Assembly line, since it has a whole bunch of ULV inputs buses that hold one item stack each.%n%nYou might be tempted to dump everything into a chest and route items around to specific buses with §aItem Conduits§r. You'll probably find this to be slow, prone to jamming, and inflexible when you want to run different recipes.%n%nIf you've unlocked §3§3The Empowerer§r§r, you might have considered §aPhantomfaces§r.

Then, place the §a§aItem Interface§r adjacent to the laser on the first input bus. This will serve as the access point to the virtual inventory where you can connect things like an §3Unpackager§r or §aME Interface§r.%n%nTake your §aLaser Wrench§r and right click the first laser relay, then the second laser relay, to link them together. Repeat this with the second and third relays, third and fourth relays, etc. until they have all been linked together. Now you have a laser network virtualizing all of the input buses!%n%n§cWarning: be careful not to place a second laser on a laser network adjacent to the network's Item Interface. This will immediately crash your game because it creates a cycle in the network. You will have to either restore from backup or edit the level.dat directly to remove the block to play again.§r%n%nIf you need to do recipes with an §6§6Integrated Circuit§r, you can leave it in an input bus and skip placing a laser there. Remember to always use §eBlocking Mode§r when connecting the laser network to on-demand crafting. As long as you do, you can have §edifferent circuits in the Assembly Line without recipe conflicts§r.
